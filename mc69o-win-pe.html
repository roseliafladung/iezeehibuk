Using the x86 works but just wondering if this is normal or any ideas. More curiosity than anything.

Среда предустановки Windows (англ. Windows Preinstallation Environment, WinPE) — это облегчённые версии операционных систем Microsoft Windows. (In all cases, I'm referring to the WIN 1.

I have been installing this software in xp mode on windows 7 machines, but we recently started rolling out windows 10. xp mode is no longer an option.

So we are trying to create an Image of 8.1 to deploy within our network. We have made the image using windows PE and when trying to install the image to another computer both in PXE or on a thumb drive it will freeze at 90%. I am pretty sure that there's something wrong with my command line as it require a huge amount of space even with the compress function but the image is created. I used this ( guide from Microsoft 20 июл 2017  Существует миллион разрозненных статей о том, что такое Windows PE, чем он полезен. В интернете приводится миллион способов. My employer only uses WDS alone without MDT to deploy images right now.I'd really like to show my boss how much better deployment can be with MDT but I've hit a road block. I can't figure out why my WinPE boot image only boots to a command prompt and not the wizard. It looks like it has a valid IP when I run ipconfig.

I'm trying to build a WINPE disc. I'm using the Microsoft Press book verbatim to build this disc, but for some reason I cannot get it to boot up on any reference computer I try. It keeps telling me boot device is missing. Google has lead me to several sites to re-read how to make the discs, but all of them say what I already know. I suspect I need to incorporate SATA drivers, but I don't know. I'm hoping somebody can give me a second opinion or an idea is all. EDIT: The commands I'm using.

Works for 1709, 1803, 1809 and 1903 and above.

Hello, So I updated my SDK, then reloaded the boot image of course. Now when I boot from PXE to my Task Sequences, it just reboots when it reaches the "initializing Win PE". I have no idea how to check for issues, any help would be appreciated :) Edit: Thanks for the suggestions guys. I updated my boot image, then a new issue appeared where I didn't have the "drivers" tab in the boot image properties. I got myself mixed up with many different versions of the ADK. Eventually Hi Guys, Trying to get some guidance as I'm running out of options. So I'm in charge of creating a new MDT build for Windows 10, already cleaned up a image, removed bloatware and setup the applications to be installed during deployment. Now, the process seems fine during partition and OS installation, issue comes up just afterwards, I get a error message mentioning the Task sequence is now trying to install applications and that isn't possible while in Win PE (https://i.redd.it/8l6r2lbyms911.

Hi, currently I'm installing Windows 10 1803 version using SCCM deployment on 2 HP Zbook 15 G1 machine. Everything works file few days ago but today it's failing after deployment (before restart and installing configuration manager) I'm getting BSOD - CRITICAL\_PROCESS\_FAILED. + 0x0000001 system cannot start on both laptops I uploaded SMSTS.log file here: https://ufile.io/rc798rcm (https://ufile.io/rc798rcm) Because I have to prepare this computers for tomorrow, I deploy the image I realize this isn't entirely sysadmin related but wondering if anyone else has been noticing a lot of failures on Intel SSDs lately? We have had several Dell Latitudes with Intel SSDs fail or begin to fail recently. Most have been Intel 5400s (Dell branded) that came back to life after updating the firmware in a bootable environment (Intel's own bootable tool will not update them because they are Dell branded so I had to use Dell's exe in a bootable WinPE environment). Just had another. I have finally found a driver to work with one of my boot images and it sees the network asks which image to use and when it changes to installing the WinPE it errors out right after that with the dreaded 8007000F. I have tried AHCI, secure, Legacy, importing SATA drivers but something about the drive configuration makes it fail. If I put a different older hard drive in it, it works however. I cannot find the log file so i don't think it got created. I have another boot image that no matter. I am currently trying to overcome a minor issue, which is that if a Task sequence ends during the WinPE phase, ie if there is an error, or an unsupported model, as soon as the last step of the task sequence is reached, the computer reboots. I want to stop this from happening, because I am using a background process to display a window showing information about the error that occurred instead of the native functions. I could easily add a cmd /c pause as the final.
