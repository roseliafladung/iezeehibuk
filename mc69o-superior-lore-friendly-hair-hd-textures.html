                            <p>About this mod. A simple mod that will improve the appearance of many NPCs (and your character too). Hand-made high-quality VANILLA hair texture replacer (HD-2K) with natural shine for realistic look. 100% Lore-Friendly. I was wondering if i could just put this retexture mod into my US loadorder, i would think so since its just a normal retexture, but i've spent all day installing the mod list and now tweaking stuff so thats why i just want to ask out of curiosity, and also if i do install this mod, do i have to put it somewhere specific in the load order, or not? Thanks. Set of enhancements to the follower system, for better and expanded follower use. Lotta stuff here so read the description EDIT: Forgot to mention - On website, it's "Large Dwemer plate metal", in the game it's "Dwemer large plate metal" https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Dwarven_Metal_Ingot Large dwemer plate metal weights 12 instead of 2. The struts weight 36 and 42, not 15 and 20. Idk if there are differences with the other dwemer scrap pieces too. It seems to actually affect weight, so it's not just visual Modlist: gt+FNIS - Output -FNIS Spells V5_0_1 -- ADD-ON for the spells +FNIS Creature.

(Sorry this post is so long) Okay, so I've been playing this game with mods for quite some time now, so I'm used to crashes and fixing them. Last night though, I watched my sister play, and we installed a few mods to try on a new save : Cats of Skyrim. Winterhold Rebuilt, Undead FX and MOSost (which adds music from other series installments). We both didn't really like them, so we deleted them all except MOSost, but we didn't think it would be an issue as we used a new save. Today however

So I finally took the time to get my modlist and enb running, but now I can't continue my save (the autosave right after getting off the carriage in the intro tutorial) and I continuously crash on loading this save. I feel as though it will do the same when I choose a path and enter one of the two buildings after the dragon attack. My game is also unusually dark now for some reason and I do not think it is the Rudy enb. I am new to modding and I am trying to make a modlist for a long time playt.

I have radically different LOD's than what is in my current area. Tree's are twice the size - more of them - different color, etc and then I walk into the area and they all change. Also - I have environmental elements like rocks changing. I have no idea what I have done but I remember this not being the case before. I tried it with and without DynDOLOD. I am a bit of reckless modder since I don't really know what I am doing. I am hopeing someone can look at my load order.

I also had this weird crash that everytime i go to Whiterun and go to the forge and scroll through big pages like steel or leather it drops frames. Endnotes. 1.

Hi, clueless is used a bit loosely but true here. I know about the basic template regarding where categories should be and to my knowledge I THOUGHT I placed all the mods in their right locations. Evidently I screwed something up. I crash a lot in Whiterun. My game gets stuck at infinite loading screens when I leave the bannered mare and I often just freeze. I hope a pro modded can take a look at my los order and tell me what’s wrong or what mods could be the issue. Thank you, Any help is appre.

I've been working on my mod list for the Xbox One and I've gotten it to a working level, but there's still crashes fairly regularly. Usually when I perform actions like looting or navigating menus. Most of this mod list is taken from Gone Turbo's video, https://youtu.be/IDt4EB4VrSk  I've put in things that I like and took out what I didn't really care about. This is the current load order I'm working with: USSEP Campfire CRF Graphics Pack GP Assets 1 GP Assets 2 GP Add on SMIM Performance. So I've got this weird bug where there's constantly light coming from below my character which is making it hard for me to sneak. Here's a few screenshots which demonstrate the issue: https://imgur.com/a/dcqfNa7. I'm playing on a heavily modded LE game that I've had running since 2015 with no major issues other than fairly rare random CTDs. Using an ENB. I've tried a bunch of stuff in-game, there's no magical effects causing it that I can tell. It happens regardless of what I have equipped 
I've tried reinstalling them and still, SLabs wont work because apparently papyrus is out of date and my hotkey mod wont work because Jcontainers is out of date. Both of them are up to date and the right versions. I remember installing a mod patch that installed Jcontainers with it so i know theres an extra out of date version but i cant find it. THeres no esm for it. And I forgot which mod patch it was. Can anybody help? Modlist: \# This file was automatically generated by Mod Organizer. Hello, guys. I've been modding skyrim for quite some time by now (since 2012 +/-) and I consider myself a nice enough modder. Recently I've put together an extensive load order for SSE, aiming to begin new playthough. It took me a loot of time and work, and everything was looking ok. I was playing for quite some time, with a level 20 character and no crashes, til i had a ctd reaching Traitor's Post, east of Windhelm. I did the standart procedures to isolate do crash, ran a lot of test save files. I don't rememeber which mod I was using but I installed a patch for Tactical Valtheim. It required that mod's esp to work. I used it but then instead installed Skyrim Reborn - Whiterun which includes tactical valtheim and other mods all in one esp. The problem is the patch requires TacticalValtheim.esp and I no longer have it activated. This will cause CTDs. I'm trying to conserve active plugins so I'd prefer not to have the same mod basically activated twice in order to fix this. Is there 
Hi guys. I've been having an infuriating time trying to get these mods to work without constant crashing. I'm playing on the Xbox X. I've read numerous load order guides and they all contradict each other. As soon as I reach Whiterun I crash and the Xbox boots me to the dash. Any help with my load order would be much appreciated.

After some good times playing modded Fallout, I finally decided to see what fun mods Skyrim has. Good news: there are lots. Bad news: I'm getting a CTD every time I discover a new faction location, such as a Stormcloak fort or Imperial camp. Caves, barrows, and mines are all fine - it's only faction locations in the wild, and so far I've just been roaming the northern coast between Winterhold and Solitude. I can't pin down the problem, so I'm hoping someone here can help. Everything works then way I want! No errors, no issues. Lots of taste full bouncing boobs, hot ladies, nice clothes, manly hairy men for when my wife plays and cool monsters! 278 Mods/248 plugins installed now after original post. \(Hope this helps, took me all weekend.\) Reverted back to version before 1.4 using tutorial i found in one of the threads in this subreddit. Reason I reverted is that I'm using sksevr so i can get bouncy bewbs and butts with FINS and cbpVR.7z. I switched from nexus. I've been playing SkyrimVR with my current mods for over 100 hours (granted 90% of that was modding and tweaking settings) without any crashes. I've been doing the quest where Septimus Signus sends me to Alftand. When i try to open the door to the Alftand Cathedral I get a consistent CTD while it loads. I've run LOOT and it shows no errors. I checked my mods for errors in SSEedit and the only big offender was USSEP, so i disabled it and all other mods that require it. Cleaned 
I've had Lydia as a follower for the majority of the game until level 34. I recently just recruited Aela and I noticed that her boobs are smaller than Lydia's. Maybe a B cup compared to Lydia's D's.
